Subject: MIDN Vantage6 Integration - Progress Update

Hi Ivan and Luyao,

Quick update on the MIDN vantage6 integration:

## ✅ Completed
- SIMI & SIMICE algorithms migrated to vantage6 format
- Docker containers built and tested
- Local simulator testing setup complete (both algorithms working)
- Comprehensive documentation ready
- Repository: https://github.com/x1jiang/midn_py

## 📋 Next Steps

**Ivan**: Set up full vantage6 local simulator and test algorithms with real vantage6 framework

**Luyao**: Test algorithms in vantage6 simulator, validate results, provide feedback

**All**: Review documentation and coordinate for Phase 4 (network testing)

## 📚 Resources
- Main guide: `vantage6_algorithms/PLAYBOOK.md`
- Simulator: `vantage6_simulator_test/`
- Quick start: `vantage6_algorithms/GETTING_STARTED.md`

Algorithms are ready for your testing. Let me know if you have questions!

Best,  
x1jiang
